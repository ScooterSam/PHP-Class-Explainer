$publicClass->setHi('Hello Sam'); //In public classes like this, we can set variables and such
$publicClass->sayHi();// Will echo Hello Sam

//We don't initiate static classes like we do with public ones^
//How ever, we can now call the function without "creating" it.
StaticClass::sayHi();//Will echo hello

//This is the basics of OO PHP though
